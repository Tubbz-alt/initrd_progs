This patch adds full lzip/lunzip support to busybox, including seamless
lz decompression (of tar.lz files, etc), but not including tar.lz
archive creation.

With all features enabled, this patch adds 12272 bytes to busybox on x86
(see busybox_objsizes.diff).

I think this patch follows all the guidelines of new-applet-HOWTO.txt.
